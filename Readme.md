# Learning Figma - Church Website Design

This repository documents my journey of learning Figma and applying it practically to create a design for a church website. Figma is a powerful, browser-based design tool that makes UI/UX design intuitive and collaborative. This README outlines what I have learned and showcases the progress I made through my practical project.

## What I Learned About Figma
Here are some key takeaways from my learning experience:
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Figma provides an easy-to-navigate interface for both beginners and advanced users.
- **Design Tools:** I explored tools like frames, shapes, text, and components to create layouts and designs.
- **Collaboration:** Figma allows real-time collaboration and feedback through its shareable links and commenting features.
- **Prototyping:** I experimented with creating interactive prototypes to simulate navigation between pages.
- **Design Consistency:** Figma's components and style libraries helped me maintain a consistent design throughout the project.

## Project Overview
For my practical task, I designed a **church website** using Figma. The website design focuses on simplicity, accessibility, and aesthetics to ensure it resonates with the target audience. 

The key pages I designed include:
1. **Home Page** - Highlights upcoming events, service times, and an inspiring welcome message.
2. **About Us Page** - Shares the church’s mission, vision, and leadership team.
3. **Events Page** - Lists upcoming events with details like dates, times, and locations.
4. **Contact Page** - Provides an easy way for users to get in touch, with a contact form and location map.

## Key Features of the Design
- **Responsive Layouts:** The design is optimized for both desktop and mobile views.
- **Modern Aesthetics:** I used a clean color palette and minimalist typography to create an inviting look.
- **Interactive Prototyping:** Navigation between pages and hover effects were added to simulate a real website experience.
- **Custom Icons:** Used unique icons to represent key sections like prayer requests, donations, and service schedules.

## Challenges and Lessons
While working on this project, I faced some challenges:
- **Typography Selection:** Finding the perfect combination of fonts to reflect the church’s tone took time.
- **Alignment and Spacing:** Ensuring consistent spacing and alignment across all sections required attention to detail.
- **Prototyping:** Learning how to link frames for interactive prototypes was new but rewarding.

### Lessons Learned:
- It's essential to start with a clear wireframe before moving to detailed designs.
- Consistency in colors, fonts, and spacing creates a more professional look.
- Figma’s auto-layout feature is incredibly helpful for responsive designs.

## Future Plans
To further improve my skills and the church web design project:
- I plan to add animations and transitions to enhance the interactivity.
- Explore Figma plugins for advanced features like stock images, icons, and color palettes.
- Learn about user testing by sharing the prototype with others for feedback.
